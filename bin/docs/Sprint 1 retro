1. Things That Went Well
We learned a lot and developed a good understanding of how the sprints will work and how to write good user stories and acceptance tests. The team also developed good chemistry to be able to work together well in the near future. 
2. Things That Could Have Gone Better
The team was poor at communication and we could not organise properly in order to fully begin planning and getting work done for the sprint. We also had 1 missing team member from the beginning which disoriented us. There was also trouble with constructing the framework for the product. Overall there was very poor communication and teamwork

3. Things That Surprised Us
One thing that was a surprise was how easy it was to set up the basic log in page for all user types. Another was how the user stories were very straight forward to complete and the acceptance tests were not difficult to create.
4. Lessons Learned
We have learned that in order to succeed more in the creation of the product we need to communicate far more and not have such a shaky start to every sprint. The communication so far has been poor and this must not be repeated. We also learned how sprints work and will be able to implement this for our benefit in the future


5. Final Thoughts


Things to Keep
We should keep learning how to run sprints more efficiently and effectively and keep applying what weâ€™ve learned 

Things to Change
We need to communicate more and stop being poor and getting points across and telling each other important information
