[23/8/20, 5:27:13 pm] sidd: Brfore that, you will have to create your seperate branch and then clone it
[23/8/20, 5:31:25 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Can I clear my mind first from these 2 assignments ? I will be honest to Homy too that I didn’t do much in this week because I got 2 assignments.

[23/8/20, 6:12:29 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: If someone is good at spring boot can they help me
[23/8/20, 10:52:36 pm] sidd: I think we can work with either of it. You could probably use Javalin
[23/8/20, 10:55:15 pm] sidd: Anyways, I’ve done a lil bit of booking page where all of it stored in a list as of now. I’ll change it to mock objects later once we get the backend done.

[25/8/20, 8:06:29 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Guys, I forgot to say this
[25/8/20, 8:06:42 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: lets keep master branch clean
[25/8/20, 8:07:30 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: and create another branch called development and everytime we have something new, we push first to separate branch then when we need to submit every sprint, we submit the one in development branch which we already merge
[26/8/20, 2:10:58 am] sidd: Yes, we are actually supposed to create seperate branches each of us and push into our individual branch. I remember reading it in the assignment specs

[2/9/20, 1:46:05 am] sidd: Get some attributes, connect it with the class variables
[2/9/20, 7:02:14 pm] sidd: Hey @61421351556  any progress ?

[3/9/20, 9:27:51 pm] sidd: @61421351556 let us know if you have done some progress. It’s good to have a meeting then.
[3/9/20, 9:46:04 pm] sidd: And @61478012473, on clickup it says entity storage is done for customer database but I can’t see the code for that on github. Have you pushed it onto github?
[3/9/20, 10:34:19 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Yep i have pushed it into customer-register
[3/9/20, 11:49:35 pm] sidd: Sorry dude, but I don’t see any entity storage code there. Could you send me the directory where you have written the code. All I see is a few java classes with basic definition.
[4/9/20, 9:35:58 am] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: @61414125030 I put everything in the dashboard.js. Maybe you can try to put it to the home page or what...
[4/9/20, 9:39:29 am] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: @61478012473 please read the specifications on what a customer variable consists of
[4/9/20, 9:40:49 am] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Nvm I will change it myself
[4/9/20, 10:13:44 am] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Remember to pull my branch b4 u start “s3767707”

[4/9/20, 1:46:23 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: @61478012473 can u pull my branch into yours. Your customer variables are wrong. It doesn’t match the spec. I finished the mvc model tues so just use mine and remember to check on git after u push. You have some merging problem there
[4/9/20, 3:03:56 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: What’s your branch ?
[4/9/20, 3:04:17 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: s3767707

[6/9/20, 4:03:45 pm] sidd: Btw how do I clone it onto my system?? Do I have to merge it with Sid branch and then pull it?
[6/9/20, 4:55:47 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: You should merge it with master then merge the other branch with master then pull the master branch
[7/9/20, 2:08:09 pm] sidd: Hey guys
[7/9/20, 2:08:33 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Yes ?
[7/9/20, 2:08:44 pm] sidd: Does anyone know how to store ID of booking tables into customer tables?
[7/9/20, 2:08:52 pm] sidd: And how to map it accordingly ?
[7/9/20, 2:09:02 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: I remember that you need to use a tag for it
[7/9/20, 2:09:10 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Let me check for u
[7/9/20, 2:09:26 pm] sidd: Okay
[7/9/20, 2:09:55 pm] sidd: If we get this done, all we have to do it to somehow figure out to freeze time slots that are booked
[7/9/20, 2:12:39 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Ok, i found something
[7/9/20, 2:13:03 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: It will be written in Booking.java
[7/9/20, 2:13:16 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Because there’s only 1 Booking per 1 Customer
[7/9/20, 2:14:33 pm] sidd: Do you mind sending the code?? I had to start the project again from scratch yesterday coz pages were changed n missing
[7/9/20, 2:14:34 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: We will use 
@OneToOne(mappedBy = “booking)
Set<Booking> bookings;
[7/9/20, 2:14:45 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Sorry, should be in Customer.java
[7/9/20, 2:14:45 pm] sidd: I will make changes here n later push it
[7/9/20, 2:15:09 pm] sidd: And how to pass in controller?
[7/9/20, 2:15:23 pm] sidd: I meant the controller definition
[7/9/20, 2:17:21 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: @OneToMany
[7/9/20, 2:18:15 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Still searching
[7/9/20, 2:28:45 pm] sidd: Did you get it?
[7/9/20, 2:51:15 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Can you explain what it is used for ?
[7/9/20, 2:51:40 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Of this
[7/9/20, 2:59:59 pm] sidd: Okay
[7/9/20, 3:00:56 pm] sidd: So, when a booking is made of a customer, the details are stored in two different tables. In order to identify the corresponding booking of a customer, the booking ID must be added in customer table
[7/9/20, 3:01:39 pm] sidd: That way we can match the Id from both the table to know the booking of the customer
[7/9/20, 3:42:36 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Are we ready for the meeting?
[7/9/20, 3:53:40 pm] sidd: Hey

[14/9/20, 2:33:32 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Oh 👌🏻

[14/9/20, 2:49:53 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Do I need to change anything besides the spring.datasource.password?
[14/9/20, 2:50:29 pm] sidd: Ig that all. Give a try
[14/9/20, 2:59:16 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Do we have a .sql file?
[14/9/20, 3:03:22 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Or we need to create a dump ourselves
[17/9/20, 6:47:23 pm] sidd: Hey @61478012473 @61421351556 , we’ve got to submit sprint 2 by next milestone. Can you guys start working on your tasks as assigned on Clickup

[21/9/20, 7:20:07 pm] sidd: Anyone of you want to do that??
[21/9/20, 7:25:14 pm] sidd: @61421351556 make sure you write a task about this on clickup and assign it to someone willing to implement it
[21/9/20, 7:25:43 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Ok
[21/9/20, 7:26:31 pm] sidd: It should be either of you or markus to work on this. I’m working on AWS and ashraf is working on sprint stuff
[21/9/20, 7:27:46 pm] sidd: You guys decide n let me know ASAP. We do not have much time
[21/9/20, 7:28:43 pm] sidd: And the customer booking is working now 😅
[21/9/20, 7:34:22 pm] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: I will do the testing
[21/9/20, 7:38:10 pm] sidd: There is a video made by Homy. Refer to it

[22/9/20, 8:29:28 am] ‪+61 421 351 556‬: Pushed to s3767707 in github
‎[22/9/20, 1:15:56 pm] sidd: ‎image omitted
[22/9/20, 1:18:13 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I just tried too it looks like we need admin permission
[22/9/20, 1:18:23 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I think we have to ask homy
[22/9/20, 1:18:39 pm] sidd: I did, he hasn’t replied yet
[22/9/20, 1:26:06 pm] sidd: Hey, could you also write some tests for booking and adding an employee ?
[22/9/20, 1:28:01 pm] sidd: And does anyone of you have the PDF what was shown in lab ?? About aws ?
[22/9/20, 1:35:11 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I sent it on teams
‎[22/9/20, 1:44:42 pm] sidd: Week7_AWSTutorial .pdf • ‎27 pages ‎document omitted
‎[22/9/20, 2:09:08 pm] sidd: ‎image omitted
[22/9/20, 2:09:26 pm] sidd: I get this while running the docker image
[22/9/20, 2:15:06 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I think that means you have the wrong version of Java installed
[22/9/20, 2:15:13 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: You have to use a different jdk
[22/9/20, 2:17:37 pm] sidd: I tired doing it stil the same
[22/9/20, 2:17:39 pm] sidd: 🤦🏻‍♂️
[22/9/20, 2:42:39 pm] sidd: Hey anyone of you want to work on frontend. Host it on AWS?
[22/9/20, 2:43:27 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I am finishing docs and still have to do the feature for roster after
[22/9/20, 2:44:24 pm] sidd: Did homy reply? Regarding the circleCI ?
[22/9/20, 2:45:07 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: No he hasn’t yet
[22/9/20, 2:56:45 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Sidd can you get a screenshot of the roster page
[22/9/20, 3:10:27 pm] sidd: Yes, will send it
[22/9/20, 3:17:55 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Should I make unit tests or write the code for the roster feature?
‎[22/9/20, 3:18:35 pm] sidd: ‎image omitted
[22/9/20, 3:20:03 pm] sidd: I think anson can do that since he had already been working on tests. The priority is that we should have our code hosted on aws for now(at least to get good marks)
[22/9/20, 3:20:46 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Ahh okay only the front end is not on aws correct?
[22/9/20, 3:21:13 pm] sidd: Both of it. I am very close to get backend on aws now
[22/9/20, 3:21:48 pm] sidd: So, if anyone of you could start with frontend I can join you later and work on it together
[22/9/20, 3:27:25 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/module-one/?e=gs2020&p=build-a-react-app-intro
[22/9/20, 3:27:39 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I found this and this might work with deploying it
[22/9/20, 3:36:08 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: Hey guys, i’m going to have my midsem test in an hour. I will try finished yesterday tasks on clickup tonight.
‎[22/9/20, 3:58:15 pm] sidd: ‎image omitted
[22/9/20, 3:58:32 pm] sidd: How do we give access??? Do we have to wait for homy?
[22/9/20, 4:00:28 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I think we have to because we are not admins
[22/9/20, 4:00:28 pm] ‪+61 478 012 473‬: You need to ask Homy for permission
[22/9/20, 4:00:35 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I emailed him again
[22/9/20, 4:02:15 pm] sidd: He hasn’t replied to my email sent last night. It’s the same issue with circleCi. It needs permission.
[22/9/20, 4:03:00 pm] sidd: And spring boot throws errors. I tried with frontend and then again permission is required for that
[22/9/20, 4:03:00 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: We have the proof that we emailed him and got no response I think it will be okay
[22/9/20, 4:03:23 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: So permission is required for both
[22/9/20, 4:04:03 pm] sidd: And the fact that we cannot work as a group, likewise we used to in uni campus is soo difficult to follow
[22/9/20, 4:04:20 pm] sidd: Soo annoying
[22/9/20, 4:05:13 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Yeah it’s very hard to do it all online
[22/9/20, 4:05:19 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Extremely annoying
[22/9/20, 4:14:14 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Sprint 1 and sprint 2 docs are all finalised
[22/9/20, 4:14:26 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: @61421351556 how are the unit tests?
[22/9/20, 4:15:58 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I sent Homy a message on teams as well

[22/9/20, 4:27:17 pm] sidd: Okay, now I see upgrade your plan. Was there any particular credentials for circleCI
[22/9/20, 4:30:04 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: What do you mean?
[22/9/20, 4:30:12 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Are you logged in from rmit account?
[22/9/20, 4:32:32 pm] sidd: Yes
‎[22/9/20, 4:33:15 pm] sidd: ‎image omitted
[22/9/20, 4:33:23 pm] sidd: I’m not sure to do it
[22/9/20, 4:33:54 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Do I have to merge it into sidd?
[22/9/20, 4:33:58 pm] sidd: In my branch there, I’ve done adding an employee part
[22/9/20, 4:34:11 pm] sidd: That is not merged  with master
[22/9/20, 4:35:13 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Sid updated 4 days ago?
[22/9/20, 4:35:44 pm] sidd: Ya
[22/9/20, 4:35:46 pm] sidd: Yes
[22/9/20, 4:36:16 pm] sidd: But it seems to fail the build and I can’t see the logs on circleCI
[22/9/20, 4:36:29 pm] sidd: It says no credits
[22/9/20, 4:36:44 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: That is pretty weird
[22/9/20, 4:36:58 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I merged it with sid, check if it’s all good before I merge with master
[22/9/20, 4:37:59 pm] sidd: Wait. We will do it later. Let me see if there is anything I can do changes under my branch first
[22/9/20, 4:38:10 pm] sidd: Then, we’ll merge with master
[22/9/20, 4:38:17 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Okay
[22/9/20, 4:38:31 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: I already merged circleCI branch with sid
[22/9/20, 4:38:54 pm] sidd: Ok
[22/9/20, 4:42:17 pm] sidd: Can you also ask him about this? I still can’t get access
[22/9/20, 4:43:35 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: You didn’t get permission to access?
[22/9/20, 4:43:53 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: What does it say now?
[22/9/20, 4:44:24 pm] sidd: This is for aws-amplify
[22/9/20, 4:44:36 pm] sidd: I get permission for circleCI
[22/9/20, 4:45:34 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Okay I asked him
[22/9/20, 4:50:41 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: We are not supposed to use aws amplify
[22/9/20, 4:50:43 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Homy said
[22/9/20, 4:51:04 pm] sidd: Ohh
[22/9/20, 5:00:42 pm] sidd: Hey, is there a video Made by homy about circleCI? Or am I missing something
[22/9/20, 5:00:48 pm] sidd: I can’t see one
[22/9/20, 5:14:57 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Is it not the week 7 webinar?
[22/9/20, 5:15:09 pm] sidd: No
[22/9/20, 5:15:43 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: What about week 8 tutorial?
‎[22/9/20, 5:30:27 pm] sidd: ‎image omitted
[22/9/20, 5:31:51 pm] sidd: @61452180166
[22/9/20, 5:32:46 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: That happens when the sql server isn’t connected
[22/9/20, 5:32:50 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Or you have the wrong password
[22/9/20, 5:33:30 pm] sidd: The normal jar file works properly, but can’t get this docker image running
[22/9/20, 5:33:41 pm] sidd: Do you know how to solve this?
[22/9/20, 5:34:00 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: So this only happens when you run from the docker image?
[22/9/20, 5:34:08 pm] sidd: Yes
[22/9/20, 5:34:17 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Where is the server running?

[22/9/20, 5:35:21 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Or is it on docket or aws
[22/9/20, 5:35:28 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: The sql server
[22/9/20, 5:36:17 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Docker*
[22/9/20, 5:37:18 pm] sidd: How do we run this server? I do not know how we do it
[22/9/20, 5:46:17 pm] ‪+61 452 180 166‬: Can you show me on teams meeting
